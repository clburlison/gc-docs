DeviceConfigManager (DCM) is a centralized repository that you can use to host and update all your device configurations remotely.

Devices running Exeggcute will connect to DCM in order to negotiate details about what backend system they should connect to, where they should forward game data and so on.

Furthermore, DCM offers a bunch of additional features intended to facilitate complex troubleshooting tasks.

> DCM is particularly useful if you run multiple maps and want to move devices across them without having to update each device manually
