If you're already familiar with the Pok√©mon GO mapping scene, it shouldn't take too much for you to get Exeggcute up and running.

In fact there's just few pre-requirements that are required on your end before getting started:
- [RealDeviceMap]
- [DeviceConfigManager]
- [One or more configured devices]
- A valid API key to use Exeggcute

[RealDeviceMap]: {% link docs/installation/rdm.md %}
[DeviceConfigManager]: {% link docs/installation/dcm.md %}
[One or more configured devices]: {% link docs/installation/device-setup/device-setup.md %}
